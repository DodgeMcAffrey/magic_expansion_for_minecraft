This is a simple add-on for Minecraft. It adds some magical elements to the game...
- Implemented
  - Fire wand: shoots `small_fireball` at enemies, similar to Blaze behavior.
    - Still working to balance this out (i.e. increase delay between shots, increased durability penalty, etc).
- Planned
  - Lightning wand: Summons a lightning strike upon the target. Make it a bit easier to get those charged creepers.
  - Ice wand: Inflict `slow` and `freeze` effect on the target.
  - Teleporters: Would like to use nametags to link two teleporters and/or teleport 1K blocks in a given direction based on block orientation.
